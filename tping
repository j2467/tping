# tping v1 (time ping)

#You can use this script by simply typing tping into the terminal, as long as the script is in a folder
#named bin in your home folder. It will then ask you for the hostname or IP address.
#and will then ping that host whilst putting a timestamp next to each individual ping response.

#One really great way to use this tool is, if a device is offline, you can tping that device, and
#then once it becomes reachable, the timestamp will be there for you to see exactly when it began
#responding to pings.
